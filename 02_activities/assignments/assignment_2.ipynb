    "This code works because it finds duplicates in a binary tree by searching level by level, starting from the root. It uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, which ensures that we check nodes closest to the root first before moving deeper into the tree. This is important because the problem asks us to return the closest duplicate to the root.\n",
    "To keep track of values we’ve already seen, the code uses a set called seen. As we visit each node, we check if its value is already in seen. If it is, we know we’ve found a duplicate, and since BFS checks nodes in order of their distance from the root, this will be the closest duplicate. At that point, the function immediately returns the duplicate value.\n",
    "If the value is not in seen, we add it to the set and continue checking the node's left and right children by adding them to a queue. This queue ensures that we process nodes in the correct order.\n",
    "Finally, if we finish traversing the entire tree and don’t find any duplicates, the function returns -1 to indicate there are no duplicates."

    "The space complexity comes from two things:\n",
    "1. Queue: The queue holds all the nodes at a particular level before moving to the next level. In the worst case, this could be half the nodes in the tree (if the tree is a complete binary tree). So, the queue takes up space proportional to O(n) in the worst case.\n",

    "Great coding and problem solving experience. Focusing on binary trees, I initially struggled with managing the paths during recursion, but breaking the problem into smaller steps helped. I focused on understanding depth-first search (DFS) and how it naturally handles branching structures like trees. Testing the code and validating its output gave me a better understanding of how my solution works in practice. I could see how different tree structures affected the output and whether it was anticipated. This hands-on testing solidified my understanding.\n",
    "Reviewing my partner's code was also a great learning experience. Their code works well, and it's well structured, making it easy to understand. However, as suggested above, there is room to improve. As a whole, a great experience. I learnt about algorithms and data structure, coding, and testing, and I tried to understand someone's thoughts."
