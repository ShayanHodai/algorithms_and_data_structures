    "My solution works because it traces each route from root to leaf, and once it reaches the end of the tree, it goes for the next route. How? I start the solution by building a binary tree from a given list of values. The first value would be the root of the tree, and then we iterate over the list to add children nodes row by row, left to right. If the list contains None, that means there's no child for that position, so we skip it. This builds the entire tree structure.\n",
    "Once the tree is built, I aim to find all root-to-leaf paths. Starting at the root, I move down the tree, keeping track of the current path as we go. Whenever we reach a leaf node (a node with no children), we save that complete path in our result list. Then, backtrack, removing the last node from the path so we can explore other branches of the tree. This ensures we consider all possible root-to-leaf paths.\n"

This operation takes constant time for each value, so the time complexity for building the tree is O(n), where n is the number of values in the list.\n",
    "Second, after constructing the tree, we need to find all the root-to-leaf paths. This is done using a depth-first traversal of the tree. We visit each node exactly once, and when we reach a leaf node, we save the path from the root to that leaf. In the worst case, the number of nodes in the tree is n, so the time complexity for finding all root-to-leaf paths is O(n). Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n) for building the tree plus O(n) for finding the paths, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n).\n",
    "The space complexity consists of two components as well. First, to store the tree itself, we need O(n) space, as we are storing n nodes. Second, for storing the paths from the root to each leaf, the space required depends on the height of the tree. In the worst case, the tree could be skewed, which would make its height n, meaning that storing each path could take up to n space.

We begin by adding the root node along with the initial path, which consists of just the rootâ€™s value. Then, we enter a loop where we process each node one by one. For each node, we check if itâ€™s a leaf nodeâ€”this means it has no left or right children. If it's a leaf node, weâ€™ve found a complete path from the root to this leaf, so we add this path to our result list.\n",

If a child exists, we append that child to the queue, along with the updated path (which includes the current nodeâ€™s value). We continue this process, adding all nodes and their corresponding paths to the queue, exploring the tree level by level, until we have processed all nodes.\n",
